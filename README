The first thing I would think about would be what the rules are. Can any tools be used, such as glue? That would greatly increase the amount of pennies one could put on the bridge(by attaching them to supports, underside of the bridge, etc). Also, if glue could be used one could put many more pennies on the bridge by placing the pennies on their sides and gluing them to the bridge. Then, if it is assumed glue could be used, the number of pennies able to be placed on the bridge would be [surface area of the bridge] divided by [width of the penny * the depth of the penny].

Example: bridge is 5280 square feet of available surface area. A penny is .75 inches wide, and .05 inches thick. The number of pennies that would fit is 4,014,489,600 square inches divided by .0375 square inches, which is 107,053,056,000 pennies.

I need IGN because I love video games, I love the website, and I think it would be a great opportunity to work there. IGN needs me because I'm a hard worker who loves to code and to learn new things but I also love to have fun. There isn't that much more to it.
