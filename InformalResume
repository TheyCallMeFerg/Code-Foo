My name is Mike Ferguson. I'm 25 and currently living in Jacksonville, Florida. I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Sciences from the University of North Florida. I interned with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida my senior year. I began working as a developer there shortly after and have been there over 2 years. While there I've worked extensively with ASP.Net, C#, Javascript, JQuery, Visual Studio 2005 and 2008, SQL Server 2005 and 2008, DB2, Oracle, Adobe Flash Builder, Adobe Flex, and webservices.
